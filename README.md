# UIUC-CS498-AppliedMachineLearning

9 individual assignments associated with the [UIUC 2018 Spring CS498 AppliedMachineLearning course](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/~daf/courses/AML-18/aml-home.html).  
Those assignments focus on through understanding of the theory behind each algorithm, as well as applying those algorithms to specific problem correctly.  
**Programming Languages used: Python and R**  
Most of the assignments consist of 3 parts:
* understand a specific problem and generate features from raw data
* implement an algorithm from scratch and apply it to this problem
* improve the algorithm to achieve better solution  
Each assignment folder includes the source code and a report.  

Detailed description of each assignment can be found at the [course homepage](http://luthuli.cs.uiuc.edu/%7Edaf/courses/AML-18/aml-home.html).
